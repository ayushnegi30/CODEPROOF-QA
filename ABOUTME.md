## Summary

Final-year BTech Information Technology student and full-stack developer with hands-on experience in React, Node.js, MongoDB, and AI-assisted application development. I enjoy building practical systems that combine backend architecture, frontend UX, and intelligent features such as LLM-powered workflows.

I focus on clean structure, working deployments, and verifiable functionality rather than demo-only prototypes.
